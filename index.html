Howdy folks<br />
<br />
Happy to announce that 2.1 is finally done and ready for release.<br />
<br />
Features:<br />
<br />
<B>Currently Patched Exploits:</B><br />
-Disables Teleporter 120FOV exploit (Allows players to keep a 120FOV setting until player death) <br />
-Blocks Server command that can be toggled(Without notifying players) that can prevent a spy from being able to backstab<br />
-Hard sets cvars related to Spy Cloak Times<br />
-Alerts players when a player attempts to run r_drawothermodels 2 (read: player model wireframes)<br />
-Alerts players if the plugin is unloaded during a match<br />
-Settings that would allow one team to have a higher damage multiplier than the other<br />
-Blocks Texture Based Wallhacks(ie: GameBanana Wallhacks) from working despite sv_pure 2 setting<br />
-Alerts players if a player connects to the server using a proxy/vpn connection (not all proxies/vpns can be detected, but most should)<br />
-Wallhacks used by external programs (ie: Lmaobox) are now nonfunctional<br />
<br />
<b>Current Utility Features:</b><br />
-Plugin will autoupdate your UGC 4s, 6s, HL configs and whitelists for you<br />
-Plugin will update itself, it's dependencies, and any additional plugins that were bundled together<br />
<br />
<b>Currently removed to be reimplemented soon:</b><br />
-Alerts Players in Server when a UGC Banned Player joins the game. The ban information will always be 100% up-to-date, However ban reason won't be listed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<B>This plugin is 100% compliant with UGCs rules and regulations as stated here:</B><br />
<br />
3.5. <B>Mods - Manimod, Sourcemod, AMX Mod and AMXX Mod and the like are allowed as long as they do not interfere with the match</B>.<br />
A csay command here and there will be tolerated, as long as it was in the admin mod config and is not insulting to anybody.<br />
Admin mods may only be used for setting the config, checking the amount of time left, and changing maps.<br />
Please disable all plugins that could affect any aspect of the match, including Donator plugins.<br />
If any player from the opposing team (the Visiting team) is kicked, banned or moved to Spectator during a match for any reason due to any installed mod, the hosting team will forfeit all points earned during the round, unless the Visiting team agrees otherwise.<br />
Let this be an incentive to either not run admin mods or to disable the plugins.
<br />
<br />
